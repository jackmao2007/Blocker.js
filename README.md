Blocker.js allows users to put restrictions on content and provides a few ways to hide contents, lock contents, show contents, and add effects to unlocked contents. Blocker.js do this by first adding a way to block the content, then set up a way to trigger the blocked content to show, then let the user meet certain conditions, then sets up animations to show the blocked contents, unlock the content, and finally setup after effects for the unlocked contents.
